<h1 style="text-align: center;"> ABOUT</h1>
<p> The word organic is everywhere, and its in high demand with consumers.</p>
<p>  As people become increasingly aware of the environmental impacts of agriculture, and the effects its synthetic inputs have on harvested goods, </p>
   <p>  there has been a strong consumer demand for agriculture to move towards management practices that use less synthetic chemicals. </p>
      <p> It is certainly not an easy feat to develop technologies that are considered natural or biological to be approved for use on organic crops,</p>
         <p>   while maintaining the same efficacy and yields as conventional management practices. These nine companies, though, are helping to revolutionize</p>
            <p>  organic farming and propel it into a successful, profitable, and sustainable sector of agriculture.</p>
