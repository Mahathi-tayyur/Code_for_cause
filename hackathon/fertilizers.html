    <img src="img4.jpg">
    <p>Organic fertilizers are made from mined rock minerals, and natural plant and animal materials. They include ingredients like manure, guano, dried and powdered blood, ground bone, crushed shells, finely pulverized fish, phosphate rock, and wood.While inorganic, or synthetic, fertilizers may contain some organic ingredients, the main difference is that they act quickly to simply feed the plant without actually enriching the soil, and may contribute to a toxic buildup of salts in the soil when overapplied.Organic fertilizers can be powders, liquids, or solids, with each applied differently. Some organic fertilizers are manure or guano-based, using droppings from livestock, worms, bats, and seabirds. Bagged organic compost has a mixture of organic ingredients including manure, food scraps, and leaf mold. Look for other organic fertilizers including blood meal, bone meal, shellfish fertilizer, or fish emulsion.</p>
